# About the application

This application is a ReactJs single page application.
Its purpose us to demonstrate a speed of light using schematic visialisation of the Solar system.

## Main page

The main page consists from a view in which the image of the Sun is the object on the left side then we see images of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and other planets. They all placed at the distance which is related to their real position in the our solar system.

### Ligt movement animation

Immediately after the main page is opened an object which image represents light start to move horizontally from the Sun surface to the right side crossing positions of the planets. 

The light moves in the middle of tge screen vertical. After light croses a screen space distance correspondent to 10 Astronomical unit it destructs.

The speed of light object is the same as in real, i.e. it takes 8+ minutes to reach the Earth position.


### User interaction

There is a relatively big button in the bottom part of the main page. Pressing on it user can create new light objects which start to move the same way as the first one.
